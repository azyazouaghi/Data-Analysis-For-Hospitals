# Data-Analysis-For-Hospitals
Data Analysis For Hospitals is a project I enrolled in JetBrains Academy to complete my track: Python Developer. 

In this project, I learned using some python libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib. 

The project was divided into 5 stages. In each stage, many topics were presented with practice exercises to help the learning finishing his project.
